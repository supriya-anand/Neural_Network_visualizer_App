# Neural_Network_visualizer_App
In this I created a Neural Network Visualizer web application using Streamlit, and a simple model server using Keras and Flask.  also use Keras to train a Neural Network model, and use Keras' functional API to create a model with multiple outputs. We will create a web application that will visualize the outputs of all the nodes of all the layers of the neural network for a given input image.
